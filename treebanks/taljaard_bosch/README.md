# Parallel treebank for bootstrapping Nguni grammars

This folder contains treebanks developed from _Handbook of IsiZulu_ (Taljaard and Bosch 1988) and _Handbook of SisSwati_ (Taljaard, Bosch and Khumalo 1991).

The process is described in _Bootstrapping syntactic resources from isiZulu to Siswati_ (Marais and Pretorius, RAIL 2024, to appear.)
